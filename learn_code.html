		<p>
		  Here are <b> MY </b> top 3 reasons:
		<br/>
		<p> <b> 1) </b> Programming is versatile. Once you know 1 language, learning others is much less intimidating and many foundations overlap. A primary belief I hope to hold: once I self-learn a new program in detail (or expand my savviness in a program I know), I have already proven to myself that I can self-learn other programs of personal interest. </p>
		<p> <b> 2) </b> I want to attain hard skills to expand my technical knowledge, to appeal to employers, and ultimately to comfortably understand the ICT back-end of health technologies. </p>
		<p> <b> 3) </b> Opportunity for innovation and/or improving coding solutions. Perhaps in the future I will have an innovative idea for digital health and perhaps coding will offer me comfort to jump start it. </p>

		<p>  
		    Before you start a course, <em> I want to stress the importance of knowing why you want to code and what you want to prioritize. </em> I started off with a list of programs I know (and how I can extend on these) versus what I want to know, but 
		    simply choosing one of the languages I want to learn for my first course did not work for me. I started off learning Java, got 30 minutes into a video, then realized I might want to change gears. 
		    Would it be in my best interest to learn Java from scratch or extend my comfort in Python into machine learning (ML)? This is a decision <i> YOU </i> make based off <i> YOUR </i> short-term vision for yourself.
		    Which skills will you need first? For myself, although I intend to gain experience with Java, I realized I wanted to switch to a course surrounding ML in Python because I can see myself applying to 
		    practicums involving ML in healthcare in the coming months.
		</p>
		<p> Another important factor to consider before you self-learn code is how you want to learn. Although, you can pay for a course from many useful platforms like Udemy, CodeAcademy, and so forth; I wanted to start with a more affordable and "trial and error" route for my first course.
